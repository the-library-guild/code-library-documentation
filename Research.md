### What are we trying to find out from users?

- Are students happy with the current spread sheet system?
    - Do we even need a new system?

Renting and Returning

- How are users deciding which book to rent?
    - Looking for a specific book
    - Browsing the shelve and getting inspired
- How many books do users usually rent at a time? When users usually rent more than one or two books a system where only one book at a time can be rented might get tedious.
    - Users can only rent 4 books at a time. A single book renting system is enough.
- How many books do users usually return at a time? Do we need a multiple books returning system?
    - Users can only rent 4 books at a time. A single book return system is enough.

    - How do users want to get reminded when they need to return a book?

### What are we trying to find out from the librarian?

- How many books are being rented per week or per month?
    - With this we can estimate the traffic on our product.
